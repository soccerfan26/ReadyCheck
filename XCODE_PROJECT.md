## 🔧 Development Workflow

### For Native iOS Development:
1. Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode
2. Edit Swift/Objective-C files in the `Runner` target
3. Modify iOS-specific settings in `Info.plist`
4. Add native iOS dependencies via `Podfile`

### For Flutter Development:
1. Edit Dart files in the `lib/` directory
2. Use `flutter run` for hot reload development
3. Use Xcode for debugging native iOS code

### For Mixed Development:
- Use Xcode for iOS-specific features and debugging
- Use Flutter tools for cross-platform business logic
- Both approaches work seamlessly together

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Firebase Setup (Required):
1. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Add an iOS app with bundle ID: `com.readycheck.app`
3. Download `GoogleService-Info.plist`
4. Replace `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` with your file
5. Ensure the file is added to your Xcode project

### Dependencies:
- CocoaPods dependencies are managed via `Podfile`
- Run `pod install` in the `ios/` directory when adding new native dependencies
- Flutter dependencies are managed via `pubspec.yaml`

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Equipment Inspection Management**: Native iOS UI for equipment inspections
- **Firebase Integration**: Cloud storage and authentication
- **User Profile Management**: iOS-native profile management
- **Historical Lookup**: Search and view inspection history
- **Configuration Management**: Setup locations, employers, and equipment types

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Build Errors**: Clean build folder (Product → Clean Build Folder)
2. **Dependencies**: Run `pod install` in the `ios/` directory
3. **Firebase**: Ensure `GoogleService-Info.plist` is properly configured
4. **Flutter**: Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`

### Getting Help:
- Check `verify_ios_setup.sh` to ensure all files are present
- Review `SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions
- Consult Flutter and iOS documentation for platform-specific issues
